                    <h2>How to use these slides</h2>
                    
                    <div class="small">
                    
                    <p class="small">These slides are made using html, so they need to be read on-line. You can
                    use the arrows in the bottom-right corner to move between slides, or press
                    the right/left arrows on your keyboard. Pressing escape gives an overview of all
                    slides.</p>
                    
                    <p class="small">There are also notes for some of the slides. To see these, either print out
                    the slides (instructions below) or press the '<code>s</code>' key. This
                    puts you into a different mode that will show notes alongside slides.</p>
                    
                    <p class="small">If you would like to print them out for offline reading, or save them
                    as a PDF, you need to add '<code>?print-pdf</code>' to the end of the URL, like so:</p>
                    <p class="small l2">
                        <a href="big_data_abm_lecture.html?print-pdf">
                        big_data_abm_lecture.html?print-pdf</a>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="small">Then you can print as normal (e.g. File -> Print). Depending on the version of
                    your browser, you might also need to select 'landscape' paper type..</p>

                    <p>You will see lots of question marks in these slides.</p>

                        <p>Many people (e.g. Mayer-Schonberger and Cukier, 2013) have called the
                        abundance of new data a "revolution". This might sound dramatic, but
                        data are changing the way that people view, analyse and understand the
                        world.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the <strong>physical sciences</strong>, some laboratories are generating so much
                            data that they cannot hope to analyse it themselves. Instead, they are starting
                            to provide online tools (e-science) so that the rest of the world can
                            do some of the analysis for them.

                        <p>Business has seen the opportunities that this data deluge can offer
                        and are starting to try to leverage it to make money. A common example is the
                        use of <strong>purchasing habits</strong> (e.g. loyalty card data) to predict future
                        purchases from current and past behaviour.</p>
                        
                        <p>A famous example of this is the <strong>Target</strong> retailer in the US sending
                        free samples aimed at pregnant women to a teenager. Her father complained
                        about the practice because, apparently, he did not know that his daughter
                        was pregnant. (<i>I've struggled to find a reliable reference for this
                        story, but it seems plausible</i>).</p>
                        
                        <p>More broadly, companies are realising that there is often hidden value
                        to data that used to appear worthless.</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>For example, information about how long people spend on websites,
                            the links that they hover over, the places that they navigate to, etc.,
                            can be useful for better understanding behaviour. Google, for example,
                            use these types of techniques to optimise the order that results are
                            returned in their search engine.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Re-captcha</strong> is a simple validation tool (it asks a person to type
                            in some words to prove that they are human). But the technique is now
                            being used to show people words from digitised books that a computer
                            is having difficulty in understanding. Across the globe, these little,
                            invisible, contributions can amount to millions of hours of work.</li>
                            
                            <li>Finally, <strong>street view</strong> is a Google service to let people see pictures of
                            streets. However, when they were creating the service Google collected
                            huge amounts of secondary data. E.g. the GPS locations of their cars
                            can be used to improve their mapping products. There is also the
                            possibility that it could help them to adapt an automatic car
                            (reference needed).</li>

                        <p>This <strong>'datafication'</strong> is spreading into many areas of our lives
                        that we might think of as private. Through a combination of social media, transport
                        use, mobile phones, spending habits, etc., etc., data are being created
                        about who are friends are, where we travel to, even what we're thinking
                        and feeling.</p>

                        <p>In medicine, having access to such vast amounts of data allows for
                        huge studies that would not previously have been possible. For example, in
                        the biggest study of its kind, the <strong>Danish Cancer Society</strong>
                        conducted research that looked "all Danes aged >30 and born in Denmark
                        after 1925, subdivided into subscribers and non-subscribers of mobile
                        phones before 1995." The study found no evidence for increased risk of
                        brain tumour as a result of owning a mobile phone.</p>

                    <div class="small">
                        <p class="l2">Smart city is a term that gets together in an integrated way
                        those initiatives oriented at <strong>improving the quality of life,
                        sustainability and efficient management </strong> of services while innovating

                        <strong>technology</strong> in an intensive manner. (CTECNO 2012)</p>

                        <p>There are some commonalities to all these definitions. Firstly, they
                        all mention <strong>social good</strong> or improving <strong>quality of
                        life</strong>. Also, <strong>technology</strong> is seen as a key ingredient
                        to making cities 'smarter'. </p>
                        <p>More interesting, perhaps, is that the definitions have changed little
                        in the past decade. Also, they are somewhat <strong>vague</strong>. From
                        reading these, is it really clear what a 'smart city' is?</p>

                    equipped with cameras and a mix of payment channels. This project resulted in
                    a 50 percent drop in morning traffic waiting time, an increase of 60,000
                    passengers per day in public transportation ridership and an overall improved

                    billion-dollar contracts to manage the biggest cities in the world. When Ops
                    Centres around the world are eventually automated, IBM's software will
                    effectively become your digital mayor - or tyrant.<br/>
                    ... IBM would become a de facto member of the government. After all,
                    politicians might tell IBM how they want a city to be run, but it's IBM's
                    implementation that ultimately matters. A new law might decree that smart cars
                    travelling in smart cities must be limited to 30 mph - but what if IBM disagrees,
                    or says the system doesn't have that capability, or imply takes six months
