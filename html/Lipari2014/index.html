        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        
        <p>Developments in Smart Cities are underpinned by a big data "revolution". New data from
            sources such as public transport systems, mobile telephones, social media, etc., are unparalleled in
            their scope, scale and resolution, and can reveal deep insight into the complex micro-interactions
            that drive urban systems. These new insights are being used effectively to improve the efficiency,
            sustainability and resilience of cities. However, in order to reap the greatest benefit from these
            new data, Smart Cities require reliable models to estimate the impacts of new initiatives or to
            highlight unfavourable emerging trends that require intervention. Agent-based modelling is a
            methodology that simulates behaviour at the level of the individual unit (e.g. person, household,
            business) and is therefore ideally suited for modelling complex urban phenomena. However, the
            benefits of modelling individuals are often tempered by difficulties in accounting for complexities
            in simulating human behaviour. This workshop will introduce the technique of Agent-Based Modelling
            in relation to advances in Smart Cities and the Big Data "revolution". In particular, it will
            explore the ways in which human behaviour can be simulated in computer models. The use of
            Agent-Based Modelling, coupled with new social insights from Big Data, is a fundamental element to a
            successful Smart City agenda.</p>
