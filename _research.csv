DUST,, Data Assimilation for Agent-Based Models: Applications to Civil Emergencies,, http://dust.leeds.ac.uk/,, This 5-year research project, which is being funded by the European Research Council, will develop dynamic data assimilation methods for use in agent-based modelss. <a href="http://dust.leeds.ac.uk/">More information</a>.,, 009900,, fa-user
surf,, Simulating Urban Flows,, http://surf.leeds.ac.uk/,, The aim of surf is to create a simulation that is capable of modelling the individual movements of people in an urban environment as they undertake their daily routine activities. Ultimately, the results will be used to quantify the impacts of levels of crime and pollution on citizens. <a href="http://surf.leeds.ac.uk/">More information</a>.,, 009900,, fa-user
CDRC,, Consumer Data Research Centre,, http://cdrc.ac.uk/,, The aim of the CDRC is to work with organisations to open up their data to our trusted researchers to provide solutions that drive economic growth and improve our society. <a href="http://cdrc.ac.uk/">More information</a>.,, 6ca0e8,, fa-book
N8 PRP,, N8 Policing Research Partnership: Data Analytics,, http://n8prp.org.uk/,, The Data Analytics strand will collaborate with police and academic partners to support data sharing, analysis, and use. <a href="http://n8prp.org.uk/">More information</a>.,, 6ca0e8,, fa-book
,, Understanding Input Data Requirements for Successfully Modelling Cities,, http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/ ,, The aim of this project is to explore the uncertainty associated with an individual-level model of pedestrian movements in a city. Specifically, we want to better understand how much information about the real world is needed to be able to create an accurate model of pedestrian movement. More information coming soon.,, 009900,, fa-user

HABITS,, Improved policy to mitigate pollutant and inactivity related health burdens through new big data,, http://habitsdata.org/,, The aim of the HABITS project is to design improved policy to mitigate pollutant and inactivity related health burdens through new big data opportunities. <a href="http://habitsdata.org/">More information</a>.,, 6ca0e8,, fa-book
GeoCrimeData,, Exploring Geospatial Data for Crime Analysis,, https://geocrimedata.blogspot.co.uk/,, A project that explored methods for using existing geospatial data and making it useful for crime analysis. Funded as part of the JISC GeoSpatial Infrastructure programme. <a href="https://geocrimedata.blogspot.co.uk/">More information</a>.,, 009900,, fa-user
ITRC,, Infrastructure Technology Research Consortium,, http://www.itrc.org.uk/,, ITRC is a consortium of seven leading UK universities, investigating ways to improve the performance of infrastructure systems in the UK and around the world. Our research is helping businesses and policymakers to explore the risk of infrastructure failure and the long term benefits of investments and policies to improve infrastructure systems.,, 6ca0e8,, fa-book
KEOS,, An Exploratory Knowledge Exchange Platform for Policing,, http://www.law.leeds.ac.uk/research/projects/an-exploratory-knowledge-platform-for-policing,, This collaborative project will draw together a large dataset of over 10 years police recorded crime data and conduct a large-scale spatio-temporal data analysis in an attempt to identify clusters and explain differences in the distribution of acquisitive crimes across cities in West Yorkshire.,, 6ca0e8,, fa-book
