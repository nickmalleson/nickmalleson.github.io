# Nick Malleson website README

Website based on template: _Horizons_ by TEMPLATED

## Website structure

                    default.html   - the  _includes page that everything inherits
                      |     |
                      |     |
         post.html  <--      --> main - the other _includes pages that are actually used in content

Note: to change the site header, you need to edit `main.html`. Note that `main.html` pulls in `nav.html` (which defines the links at the top).
