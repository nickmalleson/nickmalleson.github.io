I'm involved in organising two sessions for the Association of American Geographers (AAG) Annual Meeting in San Francisco next February:


## **_Symposium on Human Dynamics Research: Urban Analytics_**




[http://surf.leeds.ac.uk/announce/2015/09/17/AAG2016-UrbanAnalytics.htm](http://surf.leeds.ac.uk/announce/2015/09/17/AAG2016-UrbanAnalytics.html)


A deluge of new data created by people and machines is changing the way that we understand, organise and model urban spaces. New analytics are required to make sense of these data and to usefully apply findings to real systems. This session seeks to bring together quantitative or mixed methods papers that develop or use new analytics in order to better understand the form, function and future of urban systems. We invite methodological, theoretical and empirical papers that engage with any aspect of urban analytics.


## **_Crime/fear in space and time_**


[http://surf.leeds.ac.uk/announce/2015/09/30/AAG2016-CrimeSpaceTime.html](http://surf.leeds.ac.uk/announce/2015/09/30/AAG2016-CrimeSpaceTime.html)

The past two decades have seen a major expansion into the analysis of the spatial distribution of crime, with small scale or micro level analysis emerging at the forefront of place based research (Sherman et al., [1989](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1989.tb00862.x/abstract;jsessionid=C62E4EDE5A4FFEBC351A6B66496D619C.f04t03); Sherman and Weisburd, [2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12070/abstract)). This trend has been driven by both the increased availability of spatially referenced crime data, and the technological advances of software products that promote the analysis of the spatial clustering of crime (hot-spot analysis). However, this growth in spatial analysis is perhaps not reflected by similar advances in the temporal analysis of crime. Whilst a number of studies have examined the temporal patterns of crime (Ashby and Bowers, [2013](http://www.crimesciencejournal.com/content/2/1/1)), these are not as prominent in the field as the spatial literature. As highlighted over 10 years ago, analysis of the temporal distribution of crime has failed to keep pace (Ratcliffe, [2002](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1013240828824)). This is still true today; the majority of studies linking potentially criminogenic places to elevated levels of crime across geographical units have been atemporal (Haberman and Ratcliffe, [2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12076/abstract); Newton, [2015](http://www.crimesciencejournal.com/content/4/1/11)).

This session aims to build on recent spatio-temporal work, such as the recent _[Crime Science](http://www.crimesciencejournal.com/)_ special issue [Crime Patterns in Time and Space](http://www.crimesciencejournal.com/series/space-time). We invite methodological, theoretical and empirical papers that engage with any aspect of crime in place and time.
