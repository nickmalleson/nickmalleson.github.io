As spatial datasets get larger, more sophisticated software needs to be harnessed for their analysis. R is now a widely used open source software platform for statistical analysis and is increasingly popular for those working with spatial data thanks to its powerful analysis and visualisation packages.  This one-day course introduces the basics of how R can be used for spatial data. No previous experience of computer programming is required, but participants would benefit from some experience of GIS and spatial data formats and concepts.
