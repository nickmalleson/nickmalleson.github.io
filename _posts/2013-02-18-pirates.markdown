I have just come across this interesting data from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGIA). They have a big database on anti-shipping (piracy) locations, available for download [here](http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_65).

The map below shows areas that have received the largest numbers of anti-shipping alerts.
