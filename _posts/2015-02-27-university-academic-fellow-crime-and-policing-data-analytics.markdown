The School of Law, University of Leeds, is recruiting for an academic position under the theme: _Crime and Policing Data Analytics_ at Grade 8 (£38,511 to £45,954 p.a.)

**Faculty of Education Social Sciences and Law**
**School of Law**
**University Academic Fellow: Crime and Policing Data Analytics**

With a vision and drive to develop a prestigious internationally competitive research portfolio as well as a passion for undertaking research-led teaching you will make a significant impact on the performance, stature and profile of research and student education at The University of Leeds. This University Academic Fellowship (UAF) is a tenure track equivalent post for future academic leaders which provides an excellent opportunity to establish an academic career at a research intensive University and play a key role in our ambitious plans for the future.

You will embark on a structured five year development programme, successful completion of which will lead to your appointment as a grade 9 Associate Professor.
The fellowship is linked to and will support the N8 Policing Research Partnership (N8 PRP) led by Professor Adam Crawford at the University of Leeds. The N8 PRP has recently been awarded a HEFCE Catalyst Grant of £3 million to underpin a five year programme of research coproduction and knowledge exchange, entitled ‘Innovation and the Application of Knowledge for More Effective Policing’. The Fellow will be based in the Centre for Criminal Justice Studies in the School of Law and aligned with the cross-disciplinary Security and Justice Research Group.

You will contribute to the implementation and delivery of the Catalyst programme generally and the ‘Data Analytics’ Activity Strand in particular. This will open up new avenues for data analysis, visualisation and data exploitation (for both police analysts and academics), providing opportunities for research and investigation that add significant value to the data. The project will develop the capacity to host secure storage, networking and processing power of large crime and policing data sets. It will enable the exploitation of large police data sets and open up possibilities to explore the connections and linkages between police data and other sources of data. Allied to this you will help develop new research initiatives and pursue complementary research agendas.

Together with the Project Director, Professor Adam Crawford, you will help deliver the aspirations of the N8 PRP Catalyst programme and work with other members of N8 team within the University of Leeds - notably Professor David Allen (Business School) and Dr Nicolas Malleson (Environment) - and beyond. The post holder and the Catalyst programme will connect with and draw lessons from the significant investment in data analytics capacity and capability around the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics. It will also enable the Law School to contribute to the QSteps Quantitative Methods initiative funded by Nuffield Foundation.

You will be highly skilled in statistical methods and quantitative criminological analysis, with expertise in statistical methods and analysis of crime/police data and social science informatics (e.g. GIS, network analysis). You will also have experience of working collaboratively on complex research projects, a promising publication profile and be trained in advanced quantitative methods.
