We're pleased to announce two new research fellow positions at the Centre for Spatial Analysis and Policy ([CSAP](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/research/centre-for-spatial-analysis-and-policy/)), School of Geography, University of Leeds, on a new crime analysis project.


## Background


The last 10 years has seen a revolution in the use of data for crime prevention. A major component of this has been the development of ‘predictive policing’ – the use of data to identify areas that might experience crimes in the near future, and where extra patrols and advice to communities might lower the potential for such crimes. This post will work as part of a large Home Office funded project to develop, test, and implement predictive policing, delivered to on-the-ground officers via mobile applications.

This project will be of high and direct impact, and you will be expected to work closely with colleagues in West Yorkshire Police, as well as software development and implementation companies to ensure maximum benefits. Although this will be an applied project, there will be opportunities for presenting work to the academic, industrial, and public sector communities, as well as publishing in the academic literature.


## Statistics position

The post will initially centre on developing standardised versions of different pre-existing and new predictive technologies, with the aim of providing a coherent set of testable technologies. It will additionally focus on the generation of test datasets of crimes utilising agent based modelling, and the utilisation of agent based models in predictive policing. You will work closely with a statistician at Leeds, as well as a wider project group of police, academic, and industrial partners.


## Programming position

The post will centre on developing and testing new and pre-existing predictive statistical technologies. It will additionally focus on the management and generation of test datasets of crimes. You will work closely with a programmer at Leeds, as well as a wider project group of police, academic, and industrial partners.
