# Special Issue: Spatial Agent-Based Models: Current Practices and Future Trends 

[Alison Heppenstall](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1046/professor-alison-heppenstall) and [Andrew Crooks](https://www.gisagents.org/) have recently co-editted a special issue of GeoInformatica entitled 'Spatial Agent-Based Models: Current Practices and Future Trends’.

My colleague, Tomas Crols, and I were fortunate enough to have a paper published as part of the issue:

 - Crols, T., and N. Malleson (2019). [Quantifying the ambient population using hourly population footfall data and an agent-based model of daily mobility](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10707-019-00346-1). _GeoInformatica_ 23(2): 201–220.
