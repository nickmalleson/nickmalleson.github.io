I recently presented some ongoing work on trying to identify anchor points (areas that are regularly visited by people such as workplace, home, the pub, etc.) at the [IGU 2013 conference](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/research/events/conferences/applied-gis-and-spatial-modelling/) in Leeds. The most interesting part of the work, so far, is using a GIS algorithm to try to identify areas that have a large enough number of messages posted in them to be considered an anchor point.





This is the first presentation I have written in HTML5 using JavaScript-based software called [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). You can see the slides on the left (use the up/down/left/right keys in the bottom corner to move slides) or view the presentation in full screen [here](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/a/presentations/2013-05-IGU/).
