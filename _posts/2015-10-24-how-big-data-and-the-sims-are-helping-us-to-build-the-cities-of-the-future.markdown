I have recently published an article with my colleague, [Alison Heppenstall](http://alisonheppenstall.co.uk/) in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/how-big-data-and-the-sims-are-helping-us-to-build-the-cities-of-the-future-47292). In the paper we discuss how computer simulation and big data are coming together to improve the ways that we model and understand cities.

The article is free to read here:
