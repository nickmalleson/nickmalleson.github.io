We have two new jobs as part of the recently-funded ESRC HABITS project at the University of Leeds. The aim of the project is to utilise new generation mobile phone '_Track and Trace_' (T&T) data in a transport policy context and explore the challenges, methodologies and policy implications related to its use in reducing individual health burdens. The project will research new methods and tools to investigate the cross-referencing and integration of real-time T&T data with existing and emerging databases such as pollution data and new approaches to modelling health impacts arising from exposure and the individual patterns of travel activity.

## Full details


Are you an ambitious researcher looking for your next challenge? Do you have a background in Transport and health issues related to active travel? Do you want to further your career in one of the UK’s leading research intensive Universities?

Working alongside Professor Susan Grant-Muller, Dr Nick Malleson, Frances Hodgson and a second Research Fellow, you will contribute to the successful delivery of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded project HABITS. The aim of the project is to utilise new generation mobile phone ‘Track and Trace’ (T&T) data in a transport policy context and explore the challenges, methodologies and policy implications related to its use in reducing individual health burdens. The project will research new methods and tools to investigate the cross-referencing and integration of real-time T&T data with existing and emerging databases such as pollution data and new approaches to modelling health impacts arising from exposure and the individual patterns of travel activity.

Working closely with academics and city stakeholders, your focus will involve research and administrative tasks including sourcing and preparing data, modelling, analysis of data and engaging with city stakeholders to generate transport and health related policy insights.

With a PhD (or close to completion) in a Transport related field or with PhD equivalent experience (with a masters level qualification in Transport as a minimum), you will also have a strong background in a health related field. With a knowledge and understanding of local UK transport policy, you will also have well developed analytical skills and experience of the identification and collation of statistics.
