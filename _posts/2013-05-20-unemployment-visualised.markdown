I had a bit of time on a Friday afternoon so thought it might be interesting to map some unemployment data I had read about in the [Guardian Data Blog](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/nov/17/unemployment-and-employment-statistics-economics). These figures show the percentage of people (both men and women) of all ages who were unemployed in April 2013(according to the[ ONS Labour Market statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/april-2013/index.html)) .

No real surprises at a national level; there appears to be a slight north-south divide and greater unemployment in the major cities (London, Birmingham, Glasgow, etc.). The Guardian have done some more detailed analysis which is worth reading.
