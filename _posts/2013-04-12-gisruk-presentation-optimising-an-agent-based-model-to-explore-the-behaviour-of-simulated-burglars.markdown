I have recently presented some early work at the [GISrUK](http://liverpool.gisruk.org/) conference on using a genetic algorithm (GA) to calibrate a complex agent-based burglary model. Slides are available here: [GISrUK 2013 Presentation](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gisruk_presentation.pdf) and the abstract is here: [GISrUK 2013 Abstract](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Malleson_GISRUK2013-final.pdf).

The aim of the work is to use a GA to calibrate the behaviour of virtual burglars, bringing model results more in line with observed burglary patterns. As well as improving the accuracy of the model, the process might tell us something about the underlying human behaviour - suggesting which simulated behavioural traits are used by real individuals.
