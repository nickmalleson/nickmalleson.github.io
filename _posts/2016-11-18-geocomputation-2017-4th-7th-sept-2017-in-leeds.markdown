We are pleased to invite papers for **GeoComputation 2017**, to be held **4th - 7th Sept 2017 in Leeds, UK** ([http://www.geocomputation.org/2017/conference).](http://www.geocomputation.org/2017/conference).) We are also inviting proposals for themed sessions.

Paper submissions should be in a short paper format. Details of the format and the URL for submission can be found at:
[http://www.geocomputation.org/2017/conference/submit.html](http://www.geocomputation.org/2017/conference/submit.html)

The deadline for paper submissions is **1st March 2017.** GeoComp proceedings are reviewed, but early findings and speculative work are encouraged. If you wish to submit the paper specifically for an associated poster, rather than a talk, please detail that during the submission process.

We also invite proposals for themed sessions. If you would like to organise a session, please email an expression of interest to [contact-us@geocomputation.org](mailto:contact-us@geocomputation.org) with the session title and a brief session abstract by 9th Dec 2016.

Papers and sessions are especially welcomed in the 2017 conference themes of:
