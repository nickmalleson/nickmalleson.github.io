## Course Outline.


This 1.5 day course provides an introduction to the use of Geographic Information Systems for the analysis of spatial data with specific reference to crime and policing. The course will draw extensively on sample data sets relating to burglary and other acquisitive crimes. Modern crime analysis methods will be used to demonstrate how crime data can be explored to reveal underlying offence patterns and discussions will centre around how results can be used to inform crime reduction initiatives. Students will be encouraged to bring their own data for discussion and analysis.
