A deluge of new data created by people and machines is changing the way that we understand, organise and model urban spaces. New analytics are required to make sense of these data and to usefully apply findings to real systems. This session seeks to bring together quantitative or mixed methods papers that develop or use new analytics in order to better understand the form, function and future of urban systems. We invite methodological, theoretical and empirical papers that engage with any aspect of urban analytics. Topics include, but are not limited to:

 - New methodologies for tackling large, complex or dirty data sets;
 - Case studies involving analysis of novel or unusual data sources;
 - Policy analysis, predictive analytics, other applications of data;
 - Intensive modelling or simulation applied to urban areas or processes;
 - Individual-level and agent-based models (ABM) of geographical systems;
 - Validating and calibrating models with novel data sources;
 - Ethics of data collected en masse and their use in simulation and analytics.
