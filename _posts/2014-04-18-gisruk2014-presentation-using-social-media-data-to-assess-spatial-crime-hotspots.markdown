I have recently presented some work at the [GISRUK 2014](http://www.glasgow.ac.uk/gisruk) conference in Glasgow. The work is a collaboration with [Martin Andresen](http://www.sfu.ca/~andresen/) (SFU, Canada) and looks at the differences in crime hotspot locations using two population-at-risk measures: the residential population (traditional) and the 'ambient' population (estimated using social media).

The slides are available [here](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/html/presentations/2014-04-GISRUK/) and the extended abstract is [here](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/gisruk2014_abstract.pdf).

The full paper is now available online: [dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2014.905756](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2014.905756). If you don't have access to the journal, use [this link](http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/88NddpAxxMMHcM3rISrP/full) to download a copy (limited to 50 downloads).
