I have recently stumbled across a couple of nice blog posts about programming.

[Charles Scalfani](https://medium.com/@cscalfani) has written a great piece on the limits that can be placed on programmers, and why limits are a good thing.

Scalfani advocates functional programming because it helps to address many of the problems that software developers (and software projects) face.

So on that note, he has also written a good piece on how to become a functional programmer.

And who would have thought - Java has gone functional!
