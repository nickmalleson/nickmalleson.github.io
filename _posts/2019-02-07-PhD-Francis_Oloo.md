On Thursday 7 Feb I had the pleasure of travelling to the [Z_GIS Centre of Competence for Geoinformatics](http://zgis.at/) at the University of Salzburg to examine a PhD thesis by [Francis Oloo](https://spatial-simulation.zgis.at/team/). The other examiner was [Andreas Koch](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Koch6) and it was chaired by [Josef Strobl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josefstrobl/).

Francis' thesis is entitled _Sensor-driven, spatially explicit agent-based models_ and develops methods that can use techniques like genetic algorithms to calibrate agent based models dynamically. The work is applied to modelling animal movements, particularly the behaviour of birds, using GPS traces from real bird flights from [https://www.movebank.org](https://www.movebank.org) (the data on [homing pigeons](https://www.datarepository.movebank.org/handle/10255/move.365) look particularly useful).

Francis has already published four excellent papers about the work:
