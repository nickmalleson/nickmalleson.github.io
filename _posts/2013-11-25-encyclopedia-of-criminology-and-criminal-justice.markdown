[![Book image](http://images.springer.com/sgw/books/medium/9781461456896.jpg)](http://www.springer.com/social+sciences/criminology/book/978-1-4614-5689-6)Springer have just released the [Encyclopedia of Criminology and Criminal Justice](http://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-1-4614-5690-2). I have a couple of entries in there about agent-based modelling and model calibration:



	
  * [Agent-Based Models to Predict Crime at Places](http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-5690-2_208) [[PDF](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2013-crim_enc-abm.pdf)]

	
  * [Calibration of Simulation Models](http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-5690-2_688) [[PDF](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2013-crim_enc-calibration.pdf)]


There are also some other interesting agent-based chapters:

[Henk Elffers](http://link.springer.com/search?facet-author=%22Henk+Elffers%22))

	
  * [Simulation as a Tool for Police Planning](http://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-5690-2_680) ([Vasco Furtado](http://link.springer.com/search?facet-author=%22Vasco+Furtado%22))
