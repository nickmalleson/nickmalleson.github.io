I recently attended two excellent conferences:



	
  * The European Conference on Complex Systems (ECCS) at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (3rd - 7th September). My talk was in the COSMIC satellite meeting which was full of interesting research (more info [here](http://simulacra.blogs.casa.ucl.ac.uk/2012/02/eccs2012/)).

	
  * The [8th Conference of the European Social Simulation Association](http://www.essa2012.org/) (ESSA) at the University of Salzburg, Austria (10th - 14th September).


The slides for the ESSA presentation are available [here](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/essa_2012-blog.pptx) and the video below shows a prototype of the simulation in action. There is also an [exteded abstract (pdf)](http://nickmalleson.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/essa.pdf).
