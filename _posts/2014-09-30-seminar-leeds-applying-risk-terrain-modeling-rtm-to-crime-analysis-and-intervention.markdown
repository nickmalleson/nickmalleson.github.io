# Applying Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM) to Crime Analysis and Intervention


**Prof. Leslie W. Kennedy, Director of the Rutgers Center on Public Security**


## Time / Location


Wednesday 15th October, 5:30pm. School of Geography Lecture Theatre, University of Leeds. The event is free and there is no registration.


## Seminar Abstract


I will describe research that is being conducted that connects research on risky places with police intervention strategies using Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM), a geospatial method of operationalizing the spatial influence of crime risk factors to common geographic units that was developed at Rutgers University. Separate risk map layers are combined to produce a risk terrain map showing the presence, absence, or intensity of all risk factors at every location throughout the landscape. I will demonstrate a software utility that automates the processing of RTM. I will then discuss its application in a multi-jurisdictional study of a representative selection of cities in the United States that I am conducting with Joel Caplan and Eric Piza as Co-PIs. This study is designed as a quasi-experimental project with two primary goals: 1) to replicate and validate RTM in multiple jurisdictions and across many different crime types; and, 2) to evaluate theoretically- and empirically-grounded risk-based interventions targeted at high-risk micro-level environments.
