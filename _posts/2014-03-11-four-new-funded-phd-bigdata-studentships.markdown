The Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) - a new centre for Consumer Data Analytics at the University of Leeds -  is seeking talented and highly motivated doctoral researchers to apply for our fully-funded PhD studentships (full fees and a maintenance grant). Funding for a 1-year MSc is also available for successful candidates who do not already have a relevant Masters qualification.

The CDRC will be part of the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics ([LIDA](www.lida.leeds.ac.uk)), which is now being established with more than £20 million of funding from the University and four major research councils (including the ESRC). We are offering four ESRC funded studentships to work on consumer data, which are generated by retailers, utilities and various service organisations in both the commercial and non-commercial sectors. Studentships will be available for both three years and four years depending on prior experience and training, and will focus on four topics.

This will focus on the critical interrelationships between time and space, and how this impacts on the local movements of people. Through a combination of big data analysis and advanced geographical modelling it will, for the first time, create a highly detailed picture of patterns of consumer behaviour that will be extremely relevant for businesses, academia and wider society.

For more information, including how to apply, see the CDRC [website](http://www.lida.leeds.ac.uk/phd.html).
