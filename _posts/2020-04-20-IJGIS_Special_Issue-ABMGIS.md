# Special Issue: "Innovations in Agent-Based Modelling of Spatial Systems"

<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi"> <img style="float:right;" src="https://www.mdpi.com/img/journals/ijgi-logo.png?82202c0ffccce258", alt="journal logo" /></a>
We are pleased to announce a new special issue in the [_ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information_](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi) on '[Innovations in Agent-Based Modelling of Spatial Systems](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi/special_issues/innovation_agent)'. We particularly encourage contributions from _early career researchers_ (details below). This special issue call is also available as a [flyer (pdf)](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi/special_issue_flyer_pdf/innovation_agent/web). Full details are available from the [journal website](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi/special_issues/innovation_agent).

Agent-Based Modelling is a method that is ideally suited to modelling many social and spatial phenomena, particularly in human-environmental systems where the interactions and behaviours of heterogeneous individuals are key to understanding the wider system-level behaviour. Although it is a relatively new method that understandably receives criticism, significant progress has been made towards: (i) strengthening the reliability of agent-based models through the development of comprehensive **validation methods**; (ii) the use of new **data sources** to better capture observed and simulated patterns at different scales; or  (iii) through closer working with the **‘end users’ of research**, such as policy makers and businesses, so that the uncertainties and limitations of any modelled results are properly understood.

This Special Issue aims to capture state-of-the-art findings in agent-based modelling of spatial systems, with a particular emphasis on papers that are advancing the discipline through new approaches to validation, the use of new data, or policy-focussed work that can evidence a strong collaboration with end users. We encourage papers ranging from those that address fundamental methodological issues in toy systems to fully-fledged empirical applications. Submissions are particularly encouraged from early-career researchers, following the European Research Council definition of **within 7 years since the completion of their PhD** (plus additional allowances for career breaks etc.). Research supervisors and senior colleagues are allowed as co-authors, but the lead author must be an early career researcher.

Submissions are invited that cover a range of issues, with topics including (but not limited to):

 - Methods to support better validation of spatial agent-based models

 -  Empirical applications of spatial agent-based models

 - The use of innovative methods to advance agent-based modelling, such as machine learning, AI methods, or Bayesian approaches

 - The incorporation of novel data to inform agent-based models, such as volunteered geographical information or ‘big’ data sources

 - Modelling spatial systems in real time

 - Understanding and/or quantifying the uncertainty associated with spatial agent-based models

 - Applications of agent-based modelling to policy-focussed problems

 - Developments in the visualisation of spatial agent-based models

 - Applications focussed on urban phenomena such as short-term population flows, crowding/congestion, pollution, etc.
