[![Summer school logo](http://lipari.dipmat.unict.it/LipariSchool/ComputationalSocialScience/files/comp12.jpg)](http://lipari.dipmat.unict.it/LipariSchool/ComputationalSocialScience/)I recently presented at the [Lipari School on Computational Social Science](http://lipari.dipmat.unict.it/LipariSchool/ComputationalSocialScience/) in the workshop [Modeling Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Complex Social Systems](http://lipari.dipmat.unict.it/LipariSchool/ComputationalSocialScience/index.php). It was a great summer school with very well known speakers, including Prabhakar Raghavan (Vice President of Strategic Technologies, Google), Carlo RattiÂ  (Director of the Senseable City Lab, MIT) and Prof. Claudio Cioffi-Revilla (George Mason University).

My talks, entitled 'Understanding Complex Social Phenomena with Agent-Based Modelling' and 'Big Data: A "Revolution" for Understanding and Modelling Micro Behaviour' are available [here](https://www.nickmalleson.co.uk/html/Lipari2014/).
