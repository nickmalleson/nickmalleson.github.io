[![AAG logo](http://www.aag.org/site/images/logo_aag.gif)](http://www.aag.org/)We welcome paper submission for our session at the Association of American Geographers [Annual Meeting](http://www.aag.org/cs/calendar_of_events/aag_annual_meetings) on 5-9 April, 2017, in Boston.

**Session Description:**

By defining a social system as a collection of agents, individuals and their behaviours/decisions become the driving force of these systems. Complex global phenomena such as collective behaviours, extensive spatial patterns, and hierarchies are manifested through agent interaction in such a way that the actions of the parts do not simply sum to the activity of the whole. This allows unique perspectives into the inner workings of social systems, making agent-based modelling (ABM) a powerful and appealing tool for understanding the drivers of these systems and how they may change in the future.

What is noticeable from recent applications of ABM is the increase in complexity (richness and detail) of the agents, a factor made possible through new data sources and increased computational power.  While there has always been ‘resistance’ to the notion that social scientists should search for some ‘atomic element or unit’ of representation that characterises the geography of a place, the shift from aggregate to individual mark agents as a clear contender to fulfil the role of ‘atom’ in social simulation modelling. However, there are a number of methodological challenges that need to be addressed if ABM is to fully realise its potential and be recognised as a powerful tool for policy modelling in key societal issues.  Most pressing are methods to accurately _identify_, _represent_, and _evaluate_ key behaviours and their drivers in ABM.

We invite any papers that contribute towards this wide discussion ranging from epistemological perspectives of the place of ABM, extracting behaviour from novel and established data sets to new, intriguing applications to establishing robustness in calibrating and validating ABMs.

Please e-mail the abstract and key words with your expression of intent to Andrew Crooks ([acrooks2@gmu.edu](acrooks2@gmu.edu)) by **22nd October, 2016** (one week before the AAG session deadline).
