As part of their [Reading the Riots project](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/series/reading-the-riots), The Guardian and London School of Economics have produced some really interesting analysis of how [rumours spread through Twitter](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/interactive/2011/dec/07/london-riots-twitter) during the English riots in 2011. There's a dynamic visualisation that shows rumours blossoming and fading as more people oppose them.
