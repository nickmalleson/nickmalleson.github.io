When people use Twitter on their mobile phones, it is possible for them to attach their GPS coordinates to their tweets. This data is publicly available and we have been collecting it, with the aim of using it to build up a simulation of urban dynamics in Leeds (capturing the 'ebb and flow' of the city).

For example, the image below shows a selection of tweets from a single user captured over two days. It clearly shows travel between two locations (home and a friends' house?). The aim of our Twitter research is to collect enough of this type of information to build up a useful picture of Leeds residents' spatio-temporal behaviour.
