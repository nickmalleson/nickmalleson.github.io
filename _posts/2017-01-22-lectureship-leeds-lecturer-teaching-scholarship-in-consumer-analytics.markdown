**The School of Geography, University of Leeds, are pleased to announce a new lectureship to support our new MSc programme in Consumer Analytics**

[https://jobs.leeds.ac.uk/Vacancy.aspx?ref=ENVGE1048](https://jobs.leeds.ac.uk/Vacancy.aspx?ref=ENVGE1048)

The [School of Geography](http://geog.leeds.ac.uk/) has recently launched an innovative new MSc programme in [Consumer Analytics for Marketing Strategy](http://business.leeds.ac.uk/masters/msc-consumer-analytics-and-marketing-strategy/) (CAMS), co-delivered with Leeds University Business School (LUBS). This truly interdisciplinary and applied programme has proved incredibly attractive to students, and we now seek a Lecturer (Teaching & Scholarship) in Consumer Analytics to support the delivery and development of this programme. You will bring your experience and expertise in spatial analysis and modelling of ‘big data’, and some experience of geocomputation or programming /coding.

With strong links to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded [Consumer Data Research Centre](https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/) (CDRC) and the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA), this post offers the opportunity to deliver an excellent student experience within a world class academic environment. Working closely with CDRC and LIDA, you will forge links with the commercial sector which will enhance your applied teaching, support the School’s active programme of high impact research and further your own international scholarship. You will also be actively supported in promoting and enhancing the delivery and internationalisation of our MSc programmes, including the existing MSc, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and new MSc programme linked to our Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in new forms of data.
