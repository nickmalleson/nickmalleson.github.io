A colleague has just pointed me to some nice new resources published in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/) about [statistical methods](http://www.nature.com/subjects/statistical-methods). There are good, accessible introductions to regression, correlation, causation, and some others. They look like good teaching resources, as well as useful references for people (like me) whose statistics are usually a bit rusty.
